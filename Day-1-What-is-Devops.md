## Day 1 - Intro to DevOps

What is DevOps?

 Amazon Web Service says

> DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

 Atlassian says
> DevOps is a set of practices that automates the processes between software development and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. The concept of DevOps is founded on building a culture of collaboration between teams that historically functioned in relative siloes. The promised benefits include increased trust, faster software releases, the ability to solve critical issues quickly, and better manage unplanned work.

Microsoft Says

> A compound of development (Dev) and operations (Ops), DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers.


For a more informal definition reddit says

>DevOps is the combination of 2 jobs into 1. These jobs are:

>System & Network Administration: Literally putting together computers and installing everything physically and software wise.

>Development: Writing programs.

What a typical DevOps role might include

>A DevOps guy can build a simple computer for an office clerk, and write custom automation's to simplify jobs in the office. Also, that same guy could build a large server that could stream tons of data to specific servers or decide of virtualizing such a server is a better deal. Without a "hardware guy," a "software guy," and a "developer" to argue how something should go, things get done correctly because that one DevOps person is balancing all concerns.

The DevOps methodology differs from person to person and job responsibility differs from company to company.

### Agile

In the early days of software, engineering teams used the waterfall approach where the entire project and the various phases like gathering requirements, design, implementation were done one after the other.
Once the requirements are fixed there is no going back to changing it.This worked fine if the software had fixed requirements with no need for incremental changes. But in modern software where software is open to changes in customer requirements there was a need for something more 'Agile'

Agile is a software methodology that believes in incremental delivery rather than delivering all at once. Making it open to changes in requirements. Which can be implemented in later increments.

Agile is governed by the Agile Manifesto, which defines 12 principles:

- Satisfying the customer is the top priority
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
- Deliver working software frequently
- Development and business must work together
- Build projects around motivated people
- Face-to-face communication is the most efficient and effective method of conveying information
- The primary measure of success is working software
- Agile processes promote sustainable development
- Maintain continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
Simplicity is essential
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
Regularly reflect on work, then tune and adjust behavior

## Why DevOps?

1. **Shorter Development Cycles, Faster Innovation:**

    DevOps fixed the Longer Release/Feedback cycle.
    With a combined development and operations team, applications are ready for use much more quickly

2. **Reduce Implementation Failure, Reflections and Recovery Time:**

    Part of the reason teams experience deployment failures is due to programming defects. The shorter development cycles with DevOps promote more frequent code releases. This, in turn, makes it easier to spot code defects.
3. **Better Communication and Cooperation**
   DevOps no longer involves "passing" the application to the processes and waiting to see what is happening. Processes do not need to wait for a different team to solve a problem. The process becomes increasingly transparent as all individuals work towards a common goal.
4. **Greater Competencies**
   High efficiency helps accelerate development and makes it less prone to errors using automation tools. Continuous integration servers automate the code testing process, reducing the amount of manual work required. Software Engineers need to now only focus on the part of the work that cannot be automated.
5. **Reduce Costs and IT Staff**
   All the benefits of DevOps translate into reduced general costs and requirements of IT staff. DevOps development teams require IT staff to be 35 percent less and IT costs 30 percent lower.
